# This script is still under development ... would be updated soon

# Purpose
This script is for better arranging the team work. 
# Group work strategy
Our group have 6 ppls, each one takes charge of 1 or 2 tutorial questions (so-called people in duty). At the beginning of discussion, people in duty will show their answer of the question, and the rest of group memeber will challenge the question if they have different answer of that quesiton (so-called people in query). Under this strategy, there should be an optimized arrangement of discussion, e.g. we can parallel discussion different quesiton in the same time, hence this program is for optimizing dicussion arrangement.
# Definition
- in duty: questions that this person take charge of
- in query: questions that this person challenge
- round: one round that group members dicussion. (we want to make the round as small as possible)
- segment: in one round, the number of groups
# requirement
1. The optimized situation is that the round is minimized.
2. One person cannot join two segments in the same round.
3. All question need to be discussed with all member in the group
